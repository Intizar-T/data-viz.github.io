This is the main project for Data Viz course.

We use data collected from over 70 users to design an application that provides personalized feedback on a person's stress levels. Specifically, we utilized a well established connection between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Galvanic Skin Resistance (GSR) to figure out if a person is stressing or not.

The libraries utilized in this application are numpy, scipy, patsy, statsmodels (for preprocessing), bootstrap (for more details pls check the requirements.txt)
